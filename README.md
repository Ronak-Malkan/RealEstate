# reunion internship task

- For this task, I have used data from "property.json" file inside src/components folder. This data has been randomly generated using "Mockaroo" online test case generation tool.
- Functionality of every element/component other than elements involved in filtering, is non-existent. Including Search with Search Bar field. I hope that I was not expected to put functionality into those components, incase you need functionalty in any other element I am capable enough of doing it. 
- The filtered property has a grid container, hence the layout of the properties will be consistent despite the number of properties to be displayed. And it will be completely responsive. If in case you want to this, use "Mumbai", "2nd January", "$1000-$1500", "Land", as the filtering options. This will display approx 9 filtered properties.
